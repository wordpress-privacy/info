## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data, contained within text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a ’session cookie’) or for multiple repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as ‘first party cookies’), or by other websites who serve up content on that site (‘third party cookies’). 

## Cookies set by WordPress.org

Below the different categories of cookies set by WordPress.org are outlined, with specific examples detailed in the tables that follow. This includes their name and purpose. Certain cookies are only set for logged in visitors, whereas others are set for any visitors, and these are marked below accordingly. Where a cookie only applies to specific subdomains, they are included under the relevant header.

**Strictly Necessary: **These are the cookies that are essential for WordPress.org to perform basic functions. These include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account related functions.

**Functionality: **These cookies are used to store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location. 

**Performance: **Performance cookies collect information on how users interact with websites hosted on WordPress.org, including what pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data. These details are only used to improve how the website functions.

**Tracking: **These are set by trusted third party networks (e.g. Google Analytics) to track details such as the number of unique visitors, and pageviews to help improve the user experience.

**Third Party/Embedded Content: **WordPress.org makes use of different third party applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors. These include social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons), or embedded content from Youtube and Vimeo. As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.

## Controlling Cookies

Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies, or completely prevent them from being set. Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behaviour such as the length of time they are stored – either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins.

For more details on advertising cookies, and how to manage them, visit [youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (EU based), or [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (US based).

Some specific opt out programs are available here:

Google Analytics - [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

It’s important to note that restricting or [disabling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HrnWC8zBcE) the use of cookies can limit the functionality of sites, or prevent them from working correctly at all.


## Self-hosted WordPress.org site

Self-hosted WordPress.org sites also use cookies, in core there is a authentication cookie. But also WordPress plugins and themes can set/use cookies, how can we help WordPress users to identify these?

### Ideas

#### User interface

In the [rewritten GDPR plugin](https://github.com/trewknowledge/GDPR/blob/rewrite/gdpr.php) by [Trew Knowledge](https://trewknowledge.com) and @fclaussen WordPress administrators can manually register the cookies used on their site to display a Privacy Policy with all the used cookies.

#### Cookies API

There was also a suggestion by @remcotolsma for a WordPres Cookies API so WordPress plugin and theme developers can register the cookies they set/use. This should work in combination with a user interface like the one in the [rewritten GDPR plugin](https://github.com/trewknowledge/GDPR/blob/rewrite/gdpr.php).
