# Privacy Policy Snippets

Copy and paste-able snippets that describe how core collects, manages and shares data provided by site users and visitors.

## Definitions

* Logged In vs Logged Out Users: Logged in users are users who have registered (created) an account on the site and have provided their Username and password to log in to the site. Some sites require users to be registered and logged in to do things like comment on an article. Logged out users are users who have not logged in, or who do not have an account on the site at all (e.g. visitors).
* Gravatar: An optional public profile, including a photo or image, related to your Email Address.
* IP Address: The address of your device on the Internet.  This address is assigned by the Internet Service Provider providing the connection to the Internet which your device is using and may be shared with other devices at that same location.
* REST API: An alternative means of accessing the data on a website. Instead of navigating a browser to a page to retrieve website content, a script or other means is used to electronically collect website content. The content retrieved via the REST API interface for a given article or media attachment may include more data than is displayed in a browser.
* Role: A logged in user also has a role, e.g. Contributor, Author, Editor, etc. Each role has a prescribed set of capabilities - e.g. some roles can delete comments but others cannot.
* User Agent: A browser’s user agent is a line of text that usually includes which browser you are using, its version, and your operating system and its version.

## Cookies

* If you are logged out and leave a comment on this site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website. If you opt-in, three cookies will be created - one for your name, one for your email address and one for your website. These cookies are unique to this site and will persist for 1 year. `(comment_author_{site}, comment_author_email_{site}, comment_author_url_{site})`

* If you attempt to log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies at all. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. `(wordpress_test_cookie)`

* If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set up to three cookies to save your log in information in your browser. These cookies are unique to this site and include your user name and a login token for you. If you select “Remember Me” these cookies will persist for two weeks. If not, they will persist for two days. Since these cookies save your user name and login information, if you log into this site using a public computer, it is important to log out before leaving the computer to prevent unauthorized access. `(wordpress_{site}, wordpress_sec_{site}, wordpress_logged_in_{site}).`

* If you have an account, if your role permits it and if you use the administration pages of this site, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes your user ID and contains the timestamp of the last time you visited an administration page. It expires after 1 year. `(wp-settings-time-{userID})`

* If you have an account, if your role permits it and if you use the administration pages of this site to edit articles, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day. `(wp-saving-post)`
